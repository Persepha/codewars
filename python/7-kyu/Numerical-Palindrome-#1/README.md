### Details
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are:

2332
110011
54322345


For a given number num, write a function to test if it's a numerical palindrome or not and return a boolean (true if it is and false if not).

Return "Not valid" if the input is not an integer or less than 0.
