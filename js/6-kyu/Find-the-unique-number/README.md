[Find the unique number codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235)

### Details
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
```js
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
```

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
